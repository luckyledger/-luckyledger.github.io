    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does my transaction always fail?</h3>
        <p>Your transaction might be failing due to a couple of reasons. One possible reason is if you're trying to play the game without sending any BNB; the contract requires a non-zero BNB bet to play. Another reason might be RPC url reasons, try changing RPC url!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why can't I withdraw funds from the contract?</h3>
        <p>Only the owner of the contract can withdraw funds from it. If you're not the owner, your withdrawal transaction will fail. If you are the owner and still can't withdraw, ensure the contract has enough balance for your withdrawal amount.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is the result of my bet determined?</h3>
        <p>The result of your bet is determined by a random number generation process. If the generated number is even, you win your bet otherwise, you lose your bet.</p>
